# CleanCopy

I've never loved all the extra junk that comes along URLs. Tracking info, marketing campaign tags. I don't want it when I want to share a link.

Run CleanCopy and it will begin scanning your clipboard, looking for links links. If a link with query params is found, a local notication is sent. Clicking on that will copy a stripped down URL, with no query params, to your clipboard.
